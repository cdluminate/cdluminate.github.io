## About Me

I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon.
My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning,
specifically vision-language models
and preserving model performance under distribution shifts.

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D.
from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/)
at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/),
where I was advised by
Prof. [Vishal M. Patel](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vishal-patel/).
I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees
from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/),
under the supervision of
Prof. [Zhenxing Niu](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenxingniu007/home).

I have worked
as a student researcher with
Dr. [Hossein Talebi](http://alumni.cse.ucsc.edu/~htalebi/),
Dr. [Keren Ye](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~yekeren/),
Dr. [Mauricio Delbracio](https://mdelbra.github.io/),
and Dr. [Peyman Milanfar](https://sites.google.com/view/milanfarhome/)
at [Google Research](https://research.google/);
as a research intern with
Dr. [Saeed Amizadeh](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/saeed-amizadeh)
and Dr. [Kazuhito Koishida](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/kazuhito-koishida)
at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/);
as a research intern with
Dr. [Yiding Yang](https://ihollywhy.github.io/),
Dr. [Haoxiang Li](https://blog.haoxiang.org/haoxiang.html),
and Dr. [Gang Hua](https://ganghua.org/)
at [Wormpex AI Research](http://research.wormpex.com/);
and as a research assistant with
Prof. [Le Wang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lewang)
and Prof. [Sanping Zhou](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/spzhou)
at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.iair.xjtu.edu.cn/).

I have been an official Debian Developer since 2018.
I am also an amateur photographer.
