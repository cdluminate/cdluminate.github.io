## About Me

**I am actively seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise in deep learning and computer vision. Inquiries regarding potential roles and collaborations are welcome.**

I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the
[Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/)
at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).
I am advised by Prof. [Vishal M. Patel](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/vishal-patel/).
My research interest lies in computer vision and deep learning,
especially preserving model performance under distribution shifts.

Prior to this, I graduated from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's and
Master's degree, and was advised by
Prof. [Zhenxing Niu](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenxingniu007/home).
I have worked
as a student researcher with
Dr. [Hossein Talebi](http://alumni.cse.ucsc.edu/~htalebi/),
Dr. [Keren Ye](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~yekeren/),
Dr. [Mauricio Delbracio](https://mdelbra.github.io/),,
Dr. [Peyman Milanfar](https://sites.google.com/view/milanfarhome/),
at [Google Research](https://research.google/);
as a research intern with
Dr. [Saeed Amizadeh](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/saeed-amizadeh) and
Dr. [Kazuhito Koishida](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/kazuhito-koishida)
at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/);
as a research intern with
Dr. [Yiding Yang](https://ihollywhy.github.io/),
Dr. [Haoxiang Li](https://blog.haoxiang.org/haoxiang.html), and
Dr. [Gang Hua](https://ganghua.org/)
at [Wormpex AI Research](http://research.wormpex.com/);
as a research assistant with
Prof. [Le Wang](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lewang)
and
Prof. [Sanping Zhou](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/spzhou)
at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.iair.xjtu.edu.cn/).

I've been an official Debian GNU/Linux developer since 2018.
